# **Printf function**
## âœ¨by [Vie](https://github.com/ThatsVie) and [Jackie](https://github.com/Srixx24) âœ¨

Our Repo for the [Printf Project](https://github.com/ThatsVie/holbertonschool-printf) ðŸ’•

Our printf fuction works through four distinct files, each code file works in tandum to produce output according to a format. Files are listed bellow:

1. _printf
1. format_handlers.c
1. main.h
1. output.c




### [_printf](https://github.com/ThatsVie/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/_printf.c)
- The _printf function is a variadic function that takes a format string as its first argument, followed by a variable number of additional arguments.

### [format_handlers.c](https://github.com/ThatsVie/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/format_handlers.c)
- This code uses mulitple functions to handle the appropriate formatting function based on the encountered format specifier and updating the char_count accordingly.

### [main.h](https://github.com/ThatsVie/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/main.h)
- This file is the header file that contains our prototypes called.

### [output.c](https://github.com/ThatsVie/holbertonschool-printf/blob/main/output.c)
- This code file allows the _printf function to format and print integers correctly


### Yay!
